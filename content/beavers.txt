<p class="heading beavers" style="margin-top:20px;">Beavers</p>
<p class="text">Fun and friendship are the cornerstones of the Beaver program.  Through an adventurous program of outdoor activities, creative play, music, and cooperative games, Beavers enjoy time with their friends (and meet new ones), learn how to get along within a group, and develop the confidence to be themselves.</p>
<p class="text">Beavers share many outdoor adventures with their friends in the colony.  Nature walks, short hikes, tree plantings and family sleepovers give Beavers a taste of outdoor fun.  Through these activities, Beavers develop an appreciation and a sense of caring for the environment.</p>
<p class="text">Beavers are a vital part of the community, country and world in which they live.  Visits to parks, power plants, fire and police stations thrill young Beavers and illustrate the many important facets of their community.</p>
<p class="sub-heading beavers">Uniform</p>
<p class="text">Scouts Canada introduced a new uniform in 2011for all sections; if you have an old uniform you may continue to have your Beaver wear it – if this is your first year in the Beaver program you will need to purchase a uniform at the Hamilton Scout Shop. The uniform consists of a Hat, Vest, and T-Shirt.</p>
<p class="sub-heading beavers">Meeting Times</p>
<p class="text">The group meets Monday evenings from September to May; your leaders will send home program details on special events and any special requirements; like a request for parent transportation to a tour or outdoor hike.</p>
