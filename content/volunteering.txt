<p class="sub-heading">How do I volunteer with 1st Winona Scouts?</p>
<p class="text">Becoming a volunteer with 1st Winona Scouts is a multi-step process and we are here to help you every step of the way. The process includes a personal interview, the provision of three personal references, and a Police Record Check. With one-on-one help from an experienced coach, you'll participate in a three-month orientation and probation period where you'll learn all the basics to help you provide great programs for youth.</p>
<p class="text">Once you become a leader, you're provided with further training and tools and support to help you on your way. You'll attend courses and workshops, receive Scouting Life magazine and can access helpful online support resources.</p>
<p class="text">If you can commit 12 - 14 hours per month, you can make a difference in the lives of many kids, and help shape a better world for tomorrow.</p>
