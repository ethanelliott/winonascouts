<p class="text">"Who are you and what do you do?" is the familiar opening yell at every Beaver Scout meeting. To answer this question, we are the 1st Winona Group Committee, a collection of volunteers who govern and coordinate Scouting at 1st Winona. <br>Our group was founded in 1921, and have been operating continuously since 1944 — you are joining a group with a very long and distinguished history.</p><br>
<p class="sub-heading blue">Organization</p>
<p class="text">Since the organization of Scouting is very complex, here's a description of where your child fits among its millions of members:</p>
<p class="text">Each Youth is a member of a Section. At 1st Winona, we have four active sections:</p>
<p class="text">1. <b class="beavers">Beaver Scouts</b> (ages 5—7); Monday evenings 1830 — 1930</p>
<p class="text">2. <b class="cubs">Cub Scouts</b> (ages 8—10); Wednesday Evenings 1830 — 2000</p>
<p class="text">3. <b class="scouts">Scouts</b> (ages 11—14), with option to remain until 16; Thursday Evenings 1830 — 2030</p>
<p class="text">4. <b class="venturers">Venturer Scouts</b> (ages 14—17) Tuesdays — Bi—monthly</p>
<p class="text">5. <b class="rovers">Rovers</b> (ages 18—21) </p><br>
<p class="text">Each Section has its own Leadership team — volunteer adults who have been screened, trained, and subjected to police record checks — our volunteer leaders plan and lead the activities of each Section (with participation from the Youth of all sections), subject to the approval of the Group Committee.</p><br>
<p class="text">Scouts Canada requires each Group to have a Sponsor. At 1st Winona, we have been generously sponsored by Winona Men's Club since 1977, our membership is open to boys and girls of all religious affiliations. 1st Winona is one of many groups in Battlefields Council.</p><br>
<p class="text">Each level of this hierarchy serves a function. Most of your child's activities will be conducted at the Section level. However, there are also a number of "linking activities" held each year during which two or more Sections participate in the same activity to promote integration and develop leadership skills for the older Youth. The Battlefields Area organizes even larger events (e.g., Beaveree, Cub Fun Day, Cuboree, Scout Basic Training, etc.) and delivers nationally prepared standardized training for Leaders. The Ontario Council organizes province—wide events and has a paid administrative staff.</p><br>
<p class="text">Scouts Canada also has paid staff that administers the Scouting program at a national level and organizes national activities and programs such as Canadian jamborees and offers overall governance of the sections programs.</p><br>
<p class="sub-heading blue">Uniform</p>
<p class="text">Beavers, Cubs, Scouts, and Venturers wear the designated uniform of their section; new uniforms were introduced in 2011(if you have an old one you may continue to use it). Uniforms are available from the Hamilton Scout Shop, a Scout retail outlet, located at 375 James Street South, Hamilton. The main part of our uniform consists of a shirt and section hand book — choice for the lower half of black, blue or beige.</p><br>
<p class="text">New members to the Group spend about four weeks learning basic age appropriate Scouting principles, prior to becoming "invested" as a member. A group neckerchief is given to each child on investiture — subsequent neckerchiefs to replace lost ones can be purchased from the group for $20.</p><br>
<p class="sub-heading blue">Finances</p>
<p class="text">As you might imagine, such a large organization requires money to keep it running. Here's an overview of the financing:</p><br>
<p class="text">First, your <b>$185</b> annual membership fee is distributed as follows:</p><br>
<p class="text"><u>Scouts Canada</u> <b>$85</b></p>
<p class="text"><u>South Western Ontario Council</u> <b>$85</b></p>
<p class="text"><u>Battlefields Council</u> <b>$15</b></p><br>
<p class="text">You should note that a significant amount of the Scouts Canada portion of the fee goes toward insurance. Whereas many organizations require you to sign indemnification agreements that waive some or all of your legal rights, Scouts Canada has opted to insure its participants rather than compromise their opportunity for financial recourse in the event of accident or injury. In return, participants pay for this insurance coverage. You should also note that the above fee qualifies for both federal and provincial tax credits. Official tax receipts will be distributed.</p><br>
<p class="text">You may question why none of the above fee is distributed to the Section, Group, or Area, which also have financial needs. For example, each Section is responsible to pay for consumables (e.g., badges, craft supplies, snacks, etc.) and costs incurred for outings such as overnight camps, museum visits, and so on. To pay for these items, each Section will set periodic dues and may also charge activity fees to cover the costs of specific outings. Your Section Leader will inform you of the specifics.</p><br>
<p class="text">1st Winona requires substantial financing for the operation of the group as a whole; examples of our operational commitments include; registration of Leaders, Leaders uniforms, police record checks for all group volunteers, training, the purchase of long—lived assets (e.g., camping equipment), providing activity subsidies for groups, and reimbursement of any leaders cost to attend a function on behalf of your children. Our volunteers are expected to only give freely of their time. During the 2011/12 Scouting season 1st Winona provided our groups with over $12,000 of program and resource funding!</p><br>
<p class="text">To date, we have been able to raise the necessary funds through regularly scheduled fundraising activities (see "Fundraising") and generous support from our sponsor — the Winona Men's Club. It should be noted that we are very fortunate in this regard; many other Groups add surcharges to the annual membership fees.</p><br>
<p class="sub-heading blue">How can you help?</p>
<p class="text">As a parent or guardian, you have already helped by enrolling your child in Scouting, a program in which we truly believe in. <br>Please spread the word. You can help even further by participating actively with your child in all of the fundraising campaigns and/or by making personal or corporate donations to our Group.</p><br>
<p class="text">We are also always on the lookout for parents willing to devote their time and skills through participation as full— or part—time Leaders, parent—helpers, and Group Committee members. Our Group will support approved Leaders by covering the cost of registration, police record checks, uniforms, and training.</p><br>
